We will be reducing the possible games by hardcoding the first and second moves:\n\n  > **Hints**  \n  >  1. Reuse the code from Steps 2–4 of Activity 1.02.\n  >  2. Count the number of empty fields on the board and make a hardcoded move in case there are 9 or 7 empty fields. You can experiment with different hardcoded moves.\n  >  3. Occupying any corner, and then occupying the opposite corner, leads to no losses. If the opponent occupies the opposite corner, making a move in the middle results in no losses.\n  >  4. After fixing the first two steps, we only need to deal with 8 possibilities instead of 504. We also need to guide the AI into a state where the hardcoded rules are enough so that it never loses a game.\n  \nOutput:\n\n```\nstep 0. Moves: 1\nstep 1. Moves: 1\nstep 2. Moves: 8\nstep 3. Moves: 8\nstep 4. Moves: 48\nstep 5. Moves: 38\nstep 6. Moves: 108\nstep 7. Moves: 76\nstep 8. Moves: 90\nFirst player wins: 128\nSecond player wins: 0\nDraw 60\nTotal 188\n```",
